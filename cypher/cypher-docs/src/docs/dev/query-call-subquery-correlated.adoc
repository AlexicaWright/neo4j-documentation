First consider a simple subquery where the `CALL {}` clause evaluates a subquery that returns some values:

.Query.
[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND [0, 1, 2] AS x
CALL {
  UNWIND [10, 20, 30] AS y
  RETURN y
}
RETURN x, y
----

.Result
[source, cypher]
----
x, y
0, 10
0, 20
0, 30
1, 10
1, 20
1, 30
2, 10
2, 20
2, 30
----


Now consider a correlated subquery, i.e. a subquery that uses variables defined outside of the `CALL` clause:

.Query. 
[source, cypher]
----
UNWIND [0, 1, 2] AS x
CALL {
  WITH x
  UNWIND range(1, x) AS y
  RETURN 10 * y
}
RETURN x, y
----

.Result
[source, cypher]
----
x, y
1, 10
2, 10
2, 20
----

Note that variables that are defined by clauses outside a subquery must be explicitly imported using the `WITH` clause at the beginning of the subquery.
An exception to this rule is that, as a convenience, a `USE` clause in a subquery may refer to outside variables without a preceding import.
