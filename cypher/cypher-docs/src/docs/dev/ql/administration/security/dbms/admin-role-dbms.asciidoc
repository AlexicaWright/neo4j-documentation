As <<administration-security-administration-introduction, described above>>, the `admin` role has a number of built-in privileges.
These include:

* Create and drop databases
* Change configuration parameters
* Manage transactions
* Manage users and roles
* Manage sub-graph privileges
* Manage procedure security

The easiest way to enable a user to perform these tasks is to grant them the `admin` role.
All of these privileges are also assignable using Cypher commands.
See the sections on <<administration-security-administration-dbms-privileges-role-management, role management>>,
<<administration-security-administration-dbms-privileges-user-management, user management>>,
<<administration-security-administration-dbms-privileges-database-management, database management>>,
<<administration-security-administration-dbms-privileges-privilege-management, privilege management>>,
<<administration-security-administration-database-transaction, transaction management>> and
<<administration-security-administration-dbms-privileges-execute-procedure, procedure security>> for details.
It is possible to make a custom role with a subset of these privileges.
