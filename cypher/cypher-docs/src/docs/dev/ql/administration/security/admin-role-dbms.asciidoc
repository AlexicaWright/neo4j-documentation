As described above, the `admin` role has a number of built-in privileges that cannot be assigned using Cypher commands.
These include:

* Create or drop databases
* Change configuration parameters
* Manage transactions
* Manage users and roles
* Manage sub-graph privileges
* Manage procedure security

The only way to enable a user to perform these tasks is to grant them the `admin` role.
