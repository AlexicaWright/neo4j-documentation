[[query-create-unique]]
= CREATE UNIQUE

[abstract]
The `CREATE UNIQUE` clause is a mix of `MATCH` and `CREATE` -- it will match what it can, and create what is missing.

[TIP]
`<<query-merge, MERGE>>` might be what you want to use instead of `CREATE UNIQUE`.
Note however, that `MERGE` doesn't give as strong guarantees for relationships being unique.

`CREATE UNIQUE` is in the middle of `MATCH` and `CREATE` -- it will match what it can, and create what is missing.
`CREATE UNIQUE` will always make the least change possible to the graph -- if it can use parts of the existing graph, it will.

Another difference to `MATCH` is that `CREATE UNIQUE` assumes the pattern to be unique.
If multiple matching subgraphs are found an error will be generated.

[TIP]
In the `CREATE UNIQUE` clause, patterns are used a lot.
