== Introduction

With `UNWIND`, you can transform any list back into individual rows.
These lists can be parameters that were passed in, previously `collect` -ed result or other list expressions.

One common usage of unwind is to create distinct lists.
Another is to create data from parameter lists that are provided to the query.

`UNWIND` requires you to specify a new name for the inner values.
