= LOAD CSV

[abstract]
--
`LOAD CSV` is used to import data from CSV files.
--

* The URL of the CSV file is specified by using `FROM` followed by an arbitrary expression evaluating to the URL in question.
* It is required to specify a variable for the CSV data using `AS`.
* `LOAD CSV` supports resources compressed with _gzip_, _Deflate_, as well as _ZIP_ archives.
* CSV files can be stored on the database server and are then accessible using a `+file:///+` URL.
  Alternatively, `LOAD CSV` also supports accessing CSV files via _HTTPS_, _HTTP_, and _FTP_.
* `LOAD CSV` will follow _HTTP_ redirects but for security reasons it will not follow redirects that changes the protocol, for example if the redirect is going from _HTTPS_ to _HTTP_.
* `LOAD CSV` is often used in conjunction with the query hint `PERIODIC COMMIT`; more information on this may be found in <<query-using-periodic-commit-hint>>.

.Configuration settings for file URLs
<<operations-manual#config_dbms.security.allow_csv_import_from_file_urls, dbms.security.allow_csv_import_from_file_urls>>::
This setting determines if Cypher will allow the use of `+file:///+` URLs when loading data using `LOAD CSV`.
Such URLs identify files on the filesystem of the database server. Default is _true_.
Setting `dbms.security.allow_csv_import_from_file_urls=false` will completely disable access to the file system for `LOAD CSV`.

<<operations-manual#config_dbms.directories.import, dbms.directories.import>>::
Sets the root directory for `+file:///+` URLs used with the Cypher `LOAD CSV` clause.
This must be set to a single directory on the filesystem of the database server, and will make all requests to load from `+file:///+` URLs relative to the specified directory (similar to how a unix chroot operates).
The default value is _import_.
This is a security measure which prevents the database from accessing files outside the standard import directory.
Setting `dbms.directories.import` to be empty removes this security measure and instead allows access to any file on the system.
This is not recommended.

File URLs will be resolved relative to the `dbms.directories.import` directory.
For example, a file URL will typically look like `+file:///myfile.csv+` or `+file:///myproject/myfile.csv+`.

*  If `dbms.directories.import` is set to the default value _import_, using the above URLs in `LOAD CSV` would read from _<NEO4J_HOME>/import/myfile.csv_ and _<NEO4J_HOME>import/myproject/myfile.csv_ respectively.
*  If it is set to _/data/csv_, using the above URLs in `LOAD CSV` would read from _/data/csv/myfile.csv_ and _/data/csv/myproject/myfile.csv_ respectively.

See the examples below for further details.
