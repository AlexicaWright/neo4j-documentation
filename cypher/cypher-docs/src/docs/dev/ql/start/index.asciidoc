[[query-start]]
= START

[abstract]
Find starting points through explicit indexes.

[IMPORTANT]
The `START` clause was removed in Cypher 3.2.
Using the `START` clause will cause the query to fall back to using Cypher 3.1.
`START` should only be used when accessing explicit indexes.
In all other cases, use `MATCH` instead (see <<query-match>>).

* <<start-node-by-index-seek, Node by index seek>>
* <<start-relationship-by-index-seek, Relationship by index seek>>
* <<start-node-by-index-query, Node by index query>>

In Cypher, every query describes a pattern, and in that pattern one can have multiple starting points.
A starting point is a relationship or a node where a pattern is anchored.
Using `START` you can only introduce starting points by explicit index seeks.
Note that trying to use a explicit index that doesn't exist will generate an error.
