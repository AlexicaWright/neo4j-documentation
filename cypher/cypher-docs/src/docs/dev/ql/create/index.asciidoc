= CREATE

[abstract]
The `CREATE` clause is used to create graph elements -- nodes and relationships.

* <<create-nodes,Create nodes>>
 ** <<create-create-single-node,Create single node>>
 ** <<create-create-multiple-nodes,Create multiple nodes>>
 ** <<create-create-a-node-with-a-label,Create a node with a label>>
 ** <<create-create-a-node-with-multiple-labels,Create a node with multiple labels>>
 ** <<create-create-node-and-add-labels-and-properties,Create node and add labels and properties>>
 ** <<create-return-created-node,Return created node>>
* <<create-relationships,Create relationships>>
 ** <<create-create-a-relationship-between-two-nodes,Create a relationship between two nodes>>
 ** <<create-create-a-relationship-and-set-properties,Create a relationship and set properties>>
* <<create-create-a-full-path,Create a full path>>
* <<use-parameters-with-create,Use parameters with `CREATE`>>
 ** <<create-create-node-with-a-parameter-for-the-properties,Create node with a parameter for the properties>>
 ** <<create-create-multiple-nodes-with-a-parameter-for-their-properties,Create multiple nodes with a parameter for their properties>>

[TIP]
In the `CREATE` clause, patterns are used a lot.
