== Managing Indexes

A database index is a redundant copy of some of the data in the database for the purpose of making searches of related data more efficient.
This comes at the cost of additional storage space and slower writes, so deciding what to index and what not to index is an important and often non-trivial task.

Cypher enables the creation of indexes on one or more properties for all nodes that have a given label:

* An index that is created on a single property for any given label is called a _single-property index_.
* An index that is created on more than one property for any given label is called a _composite index_.
  Differences in the usage patterns between composite and single-property indexes are described in
  <<schema-index-single-vs-composite-index, composite index limitations>> and shown in the examples below.

Once an index has been created, it will automatically be managed and kept up to date by the database when the graph is changed.
Neo4j will automatically pick up and start using the index once it has been created and brought online.

[NOTE]
<<query-using>> describes how to make the Cypher planner use specific indexes (especially in cases where the planner would not necessarily have used them).

=== Composite index limitations

Unlike single-property indexes, composite indexes currently support only a subset of predicates:

* equality check: `n.prop = value`
* list membership check: `n.prop IN list`
* existence check: `exists(n.prop)`
* range search: `n.prop > value`
* prefix search: `STARTS WITH`

However, predicates might be rewritten into existence check and a filter.
The restrictions for what the index can handle without rewrites are, in order:

* `0-* equality check and list membership check predicates`
* `0-1 range or prefix search predicate`
* `0-* existence check predicates`

Predicates not following the order above will be rewritten to existence check and filter.
For example, an index on `:Label(prop1,prop2,prop3,prop4,prop5,prop6)` and predicates:

```
equality on prop1, equality on prop2, range on prop3, range on prop4, equality on prop5, exists on prop6
```

will be rewritten as:

```
equality on prop1, equality on prop2, range on prop3, exists on prop4, exists on prop5, exists on prop6
```

with filters on `prop4` and `prop5` for the range and equality predicates.

Queries containing the following types of predicates on properties in the index are not supported (not even as existence check and filter):

* suffix search: `ENDS WITH`
* substring search: `CONTAINS`

Composite indexes require predicates on all properties indexed.
If there are predicates on only a subset of the indexed properties, it will not be possible to use the composite index.
To get this kind of fallback behavior, it is necessary to create additional indexes on the relevant sub-set of properties or on single properties.
