**Read Clauses**

These comprise clauses that read data from the database.

The flow of data within a Cypher query is an unordered sequence of maps with key-value pairs -- a set of possible bindings between the variables in the query and values derived from the database.
This set is refined and augmented by subsequent parts of the query.

|Clause                                     |   Description
|<<query-match,MATCH>>                      |   Specify the patterns to search for in the database.
|<<query-optional-match,OPTIONAL MATCH>>    |   Specify the patterns to search for in the database while using `nulls` for missing parts of the pattern.
|<<query-where,WHERE>>                      |   Adds constraints to the patterns in a `MATCH` or `OPTIONAL MATCH` clause or filter the results of a `WITH` clause.
|<<query-start,START>>                      |   Find starting points through legacy indexes.

**Write Clauses**

These comprise clauses that write the data to the database.

[options="header"]
|===
|Clause                                     |   Description
|<<query-create,CREATE>>                    |   Create nodes and relationships.
|<<query-merge,MERGE>>                      |   Ensures that a pattern exists in the graph. Either the pattern already exists, or it needs to be created.
|<<query-merge-on-create-on-match,ON CREATE>> |   Used in conjunction with `MERGE`, specifying the actions to take if the pattern needs to be created.
|<<query-merge-on-create-on-match,ON MATCH>>  |   Used in conjunction with `MERGE`, specifying the actions to take if the pattern already exists.
|<<query-set,SET>>                          |   Update labels on nodes and properties on nodes and relationships.
|<<query-delete,DELETE>>                    |   Delete graph elements — nodes, relationships or paths. Any node to be deleted must also have all associated relationships explicitly deleted.
|<<query-delete,DETACH DELETE>>             |   Delete a node or set of nodes. All associated relationships will automatically be deleted.
|<<query-remove,REMOVE>>                    |   Remove properties and labels from nodes and relationships.
|<<query-foreach,FOREACH>>                  |   Update data within a list, whether components of a path, or the result of aggregation.
|<<query-create-unique,CREATE UNIQUE>>      |   A mixture of `MATCH` and `CREATE`, matching what it can, and creating what is missing.
|<<query-load-csv,LOAD CSV>>                |   Use when importing data from CSV files.
|===

**General Clauses**

These comprise general clauses that work in conjunction with other clauses.

[options="header"]
|===
|Clause                      |   Description
|<<query-return,RETURN>>     | Defines what to include in the query result set.
|<<query-order,ORDER BY>>    | A sub-clause following `RETURN` or `WITH`, specifying that the output should be sorted in particular way.
|<<query-limit,LIMIT>>       | Constrains the number of rows in the output.
|<<query-skip,SKIP>>         | Defines from which row to start including the rows in the output.
|<<query-with,WITH>>         | Allows query parts to be chained together, piping the results from one to be used as starting points or criteria in the next.
|<<query-unwind,UNWIND>>     | Expands a list into a sequence of rows.
|<<query-union,UNION>>       | Combines the result of multiple queries.
|<<query-call,CALL>>         | Invoke a procedure deployed in the database.
