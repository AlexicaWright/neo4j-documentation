== Deprecated property operators

[NOTE]
Since version 2.0, the previously supported property operators `?` and `!` have been removed.
This syntax is no longer supported.
Missing properties are now returned as `null`.
Use `(NOT(exists(<ident>.prop)) OR <ident>.prop=<value>)` if the old behavior of the `?` operator is required.
In addition, the use of `?` for optional relationships has been removed in favor of the `OPTIONAL MATCH` clause.
