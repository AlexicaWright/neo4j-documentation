Maps
=====

Cypher has comprehensive support for maps.

* <<cypher-literal-maps, Literal maps>>
* <<cypher-map-projection, Map projection>>


[[cypher-literal-maps]]
== Literal maps ==

From Cypher, you can also construct maps. Through REST you will get JSON objects; in Java they will be `java.util.Map<String,Object>`.

###
RETURN {key: 'Value', listKey: [{inner: 'Map1'}, {inner: 'Map2'}]}###

[[cypher-map-projection]]
== Map projection ==
Cypher supports a concept called "map projections".
It allows for easily constructing map projections from nodes, relationships and other map values.

A map projection begins with the variable bound to the graph entity to be projected from, and contains a body of coma separated map elements, enclosed by `{` and  `}`.

`map_variable {map_element, [, ...n]}`

A map element projects one or more key value pair to the map projection.
There exists four different types of map projection elements:

* Property selector - Projects the property name as the key, and the value from the `map_variable` as the value for the projection.

* Literal entry - This is a key value pair, with the value being arbitrary expression `key: <expression>`.

* Variable selector - Projects an variable, with the variable name as the key, and the value the variable is pointing to as the value of the projection.
Its syntax is just the variable.

* All-properties selector - projects all key value pair from the `map_variable` value.

Note that if the `map_variable` points to a null value, the whole map projection will evaluate to null.

=== Examples of map projections ===

Find Charlie Sheen and return data about him and the movies he has acted in.
This example shows an example of map projection with a literal entry, which in turn also uses map projection inside the aggregating `collect()`.

###
MATCH (actor:Person {name: 'Charlie Sheen'})-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie)
RETURN actor{
        .name,
        .realName,
         movies: collect(movie{ .title, .year })
      }###


Find all persons that have acted in movies, and show number for each.
This example introduces an variable with the count, and uses an variable selector to project the value.

###
MATCH (actor:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie)
WITH actor, count(movie) as nrOfMovies
RETURN actor{
        .name,
         nrOfMovies
      }###

Again, focusing on *'Charlie Sheen'*, this time returning all properties from the node.
Here we use an all-properties selector to project all the node properties, and additionally, explicitly project the property `age`.
Since this property does not exist on the node, a null value is projected instead.

###
MATCH (actor:Person {name: 'Charlie Sheen'})
RETURN actor{.*, .age}###

}
