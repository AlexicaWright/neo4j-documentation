Operators
=========

[[query-operators-mathematical]]
== Mathematical operators ==

The mathematical operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%`, `^`.

[[query-operators-comparison]]
== Comparison operators ==

The comparison operators include `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `\<=`, `>=`, `IS NULL`, and `IS NOT NULL`.
See <<cypher-comparison>> on their behavior.

The operators `STARTS WITH`, `ENDS WITH` and `CONTAINS` can be used to search for a string value by its content.

[[query-operators-boolean]]
== Boolean operators ==
The boolean operators are `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`.

[[query-operators-string]]
== String operators ==

Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator.
For regular expression matching the `=~` operator is used.

[[query-operators-list]]
== List operators ==

Lists can be concatenated using the `+` operator.
The `IN` operator can be used to check if an element exists in a list.

[[query-operators-property]]
== Property operators ==

[NOTE]
Since version 2.0, the previously supported property operators `?` and `!` have been removed.
This syntax is no longer supported.
Missing properties are now returned as `null`.
Please use `(NOT(has(<ident>.prop)) OR <ident>.prop=<value>)` if you really need the old behavior of the `?` operator.
-- Also, the use of `?` for optional relationships has been removed in favor of the newly-introduced `OPTIONAL MATCH` clause.
