|Clause                                     | Type      |   Description
|<<query-call,CALL>>                        | General   | Invoke a procedure deployed in the database.
|<<query-create,CREATE>>                    | Write     |  Create nodes and relationships.
|<<query-create-unique,CREATE UNIQUE>>      | Write     |  A mixture of `MATCH` and `CREATE`, matching what it can, and creating what is missing.
|<<query-delete,DELETE>>                    | Write     |  Delete graph elements — nodes, relationships or paths. Any node to be deleted must also have all associated relationships explicitly deleted.
|<<query-delete,DETACH DELETE>>             | Write     |  Delete a node or set of nodes. All associated relationships will automatically be deleted.
|<<query-foreach,FOREACH>>                  | Write     |  Update data within a list, whether components of a path, or the result of aggregation.
|<<query-load-csv,LOAD CSV>>                | Write     |  Use when importing data from CSV files.
|<<query-match,MATCH>>                      | Read      |  Specify the patterns to search for in the database.
|<<query-merge,MERGE>>                      | Write     |  Ensures that a pattern exists in the graph. Either the pattern already exists, or it needs to be created.
|<<query-optional-match,OPTIONAL MATCH>>    | Read      |  Specify the patterns to search for in the database while using `nulls` for missing parts of the pattern.
|<<query-remove,REMOVE>>                    | Write     |  Remove properties and labels from nodes and relationships.
|<<query-return,RETURN>>                    | General   |  Defines what to include in the query result set.
|<<query-set,SET>>                          | Write     |  Update labels on nodes and properties on nodes and relationships.
|<<query-start,START>>                      | Read      |  Find starting points through legacy indexes.
|<<query-union,UNION>>                      | General   |  Combines the result of multiple queries.
|<<query-unwind,UNWIND>>                    | General   |  Expands a list into a sequence of rows.
|<<query-with,WITH>>                        | General   |  Allows query parts to be chained together, piping the results from one to be used as starting points or criteria in the next.

|<<query-merge-on-create-on-match,ON CREATE>>   | Write     | Used in conjunction with `MERGE`, specifying the actions to take if the pattern needs to be created.
|<<query-merge-on-create-on-match,ON MATCH>>    | Write     | Used in conjunction with `MERGE`, specifying the actions to take if the pattern already exists.
|<<query-order,ORDER BY>>                       | General   | A sub-clause following `RETURN` or `WITH`, specifying that the output should be sorted in particular way.
|<<query-skip,SKIP>>                            | General   | Defines from which row to start including the rows in the output.
|<<query-where,WHERE>>                          | Read      | Adds constraints to the patterns in a `MATCH` or `OPTIONAL MATCH` clause or filter the results of a `WITH` clause.
