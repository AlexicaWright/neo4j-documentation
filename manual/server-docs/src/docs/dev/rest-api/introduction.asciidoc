The Neo4j REST API is designed with discoverability in mind, so that you can start with a `GET` on the <<rest-api-service-root>> and from there discover URIs to perform other requests.
While the examples below use correct URIs best practice is to _discover URIs where possible_, rather than relying on the layout in these examples.
This allows for handling changes to the URI structure gracefully.

The default representation is http://www.json.org/[json], both for responses and for data sent with `POST`/`PUT` requests.

To interact with the JSON interface you must explicitly set the request header `Accept:application/json` for those requests that responds with data.
You should also set the header `Content-Type:application/json` if your request sends data, for example when you're creating a relationship.
The examples include the relevant request and response headers.

The server supports streaming results, with better performance and lower memory overhead.
See <<rest-api-streaming>> for more information.
