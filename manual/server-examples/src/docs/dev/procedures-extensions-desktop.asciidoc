= Installing Procedures and Extensions in Neo4j Desktop

Extensions can be be deployed also when using Neo4j Desktop.
Neo4j Desktop will add all jars in _%ProgramFiles%\Neo4j Community\plugins_ to the classpath, but please note that nested directories for plugins are not supported.

Otherwise extensions are subject to the same rules as usual.
Please note when configuring server extensions that _neo4j.conf_ for Neo4j Desktop lives in _%APPDATA%\Neo4j Community_.
